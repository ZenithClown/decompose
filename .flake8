# flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
# run the flake code linting checks in localhost using the above command
# other specific settings to flake8 is described below

  # the following error/warning definations are ignored
  # as they are sometimes violated by black: https://github.com/psf/black
  # and is also a personal preference, as spaces before and after an
  # operator makes the code more readable to `CODEOWNER` (i.e. self)
  # E20{1-3} whitespace before '{', '}', and ':' respectively
  # E221 multiple spaces before operator
  # E251 unexpected spaces around keyword / parameter equals
  # E261 at least two spaces before inline comment
  ignore = E201, E202, E203, E221, E251, E261

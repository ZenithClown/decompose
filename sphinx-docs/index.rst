A implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Algorithm
for determining the Functional Age of Power Transformer, for the Paper Titled
"Reliable Estimation of Dissipation Factor of In-service Power Transformer".

Paper Abstract
--------------

Insulation failure is a severe threat to high voltage equipment, and its protection using
a reliable and efficient diagnostic tool has always been the interest to power utilities.
Many traditional and newer techniques are available. Due to the complex aging process of oil-paper
insulation, experts generally perform assessments after carefully evaluating measurement data.
The paper presents a methodology to analyze recovery voltage measurement data to estimate aging
sensitive performance parameters (dissipation factor).

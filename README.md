## Abstract

<p align = "justify">Insulation failure is a severe threat to high voltage equipment, and its protection using a reliable and efficient diagnostic tool has always been the interest to power utilities. The modern power industry relies heavily on the transformer, which focuses on providing an interruption-free constant power factor, forcing the utilities to keep operating as much as possible, requiring a fault-free operation of transformers. Many traditional and newer techniques are available; however, due to the complex aging process of oil-paper insulation under the influence of different types of stresses, insulation condition assessment is generally performed by experts after carefully evaluating additional measurement data. The paper presents an approach to determine the dielectric dissipation factor of the power transformer insulation, considering transformer physical and operational parameters in addition to the recovery voltage measurement.</p>
